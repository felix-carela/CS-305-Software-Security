# CS-305-Software-Security

# Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?
Artemis Financial is a consulting company that develops individualized financial plans for their customers, including savings, retirement, investments, and insurance. They required modernization of their operations with a focus on software security, specifically the implementation of secure communication mechanisms and data verification steps in their web application to protect client data and financial information.

# What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?
I excelled in identifying and addressing the vulnerabilities in the client's software by implementing Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) for encryption and SHA-256 for hashing. Secure coding is vital to protect against data breaches, maintain customer trust, and ensure the integrity and confidentiality of sensitive data. Software security significantly contributes to a company's reputation, legal compliance, and protection against financial losses.

# What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?
The challenging yet helpful part was the thorough application architecture analysis. This involved scrutinizing various components like APIs, data structures, and input validation methods. It was intricate but crucial for identifying potential vulnerabilities and ensuring robust security measures.

# How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?
I increased security layers by implementing secure coding practices, including encryption, secure API interactions, and error handling. For future assessments, I would use tools like static application security testing (SAST) and dynamic application security testing (DAST) to identify vulnerabilities and decide on appropriate mitigation strategies.

# How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
I ensured code and application functionality and security through rigorous testing, including functional testing and secondary testing with tools like dependency-check reports. After refactoring, I re-conducted these tests to ensure no new vulnerabilities were introduced.

# What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?
The resources and tools included AES for encryption, SHA-256 for hashing, and secure key management strategies. Secure coding practices like encapsulation, API security, and secure error handling will be beneficial for future assignments.

# Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?
I would show the completed Artemis Financial Practices for Secure Software Report, demonstrating my ability to implement and manage sophisticated security measures in software development, reflecting my skills in secure coding, vulnerability assessment, and the practical application of encryption and hashing algorithms.
